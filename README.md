# Insurance Cost Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting insurance charges for customers using machine learning.
The model estimates insurance costs based on customer attributes such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region.

## Problem Statement
Insurance companies need a reliable method to estimate insurance charges based on multiple customer factors.
Manual estimation is inefficient and may lead to inconsistent results.
This project applies machine learning to automate and improve the prediction process.

## Machine Learning Workflow
- Data loading and understanding
- Data preprocessing (encoding and scaling)
- Feature selection and target variable definition
- Train-test split
- Model training
- Model evaluation
- Prediction on new customer data

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Model Performance
The trained model achieved approximately 80% accuracy on the test dataset, indicating good performance on unseen data.

## Prediction
The model can predict insurance charges for a new customer by taking input features such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region.
This demonstrates the practical use of the model beyond evaluation metrics.

  Contains the complete implementation including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow and shows how predictive models can be applied to real-world problems.
It helped in understanding how trained models can be used for decision-making rather than just achieving accuracy.

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with different machine learning algorithms
- Perform hyperparameter tuning
- Deploy the model using a web framework such as Flask or Streamlit
